# `hive-router`

A fully open-source MIT-licensed GraphQL API router that can act as a [GraphQL federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) Router, built with Rust for maximum performance and robustness.

This crate helps you create a custom build of the Hive Router with your own plugins.

- To learn how to extend the router, see the [extensibility guide](https://graphql-hive.com/docs/router/extensibility/plugin_system).
- If you don't need to extend the router, refer to the [getting started guide](https://graphql-hive.com/docs/router/getting-started).
