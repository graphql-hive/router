# `hive-router`

A fully open-source MIT-licensed GraphQL API router that can act as a [GraphQL federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) Router, built with Rust for maximum performance and robustness.

This crate helps you to create a custom build for the extended version of Hive Router with your plugins.

If you don't want to extend and build your own version of Hive Router, [see the getting started guide](https://graphql-hive.com/docs/router/getting-started).

Or if you want to extend Hive Router with your own plugins, and build and run it, see the [extensibility guide](https://graphql-hive.com/docs/router/extensibility/plugin_system).
