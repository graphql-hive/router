# Support environment variables in expressions

We have added support for using environment variables in expressions within the Hive Router configuration.

Example usage:
```
headers:
  all:
    response:
      - insert:
          name: "x-powered-by"
          expression: env("SERVICE_NAME", "default-value")
```
