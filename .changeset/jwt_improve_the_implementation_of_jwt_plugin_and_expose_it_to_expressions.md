# Improve the implementation of jwt plugin and expose it to expressions.

The following properties are available in the request object exposed to VRL expressions:
- `request.jwt` will always be an object
- `request.jwt.authenticated` with value of true or false
- `request.jwt.prefix` can either be a string or null (if prefix is not used)
- `request.jwt.token` can be string (when authenticated=true) or null (when authenticated=false)
- `request.jwt.claims` will always be an array (either empty or with values), containing the full JWT token claims payload.
- `request.jwt.scopes` will always be an array (either empty or with values), containing the scopes extracted from the claims

Here are examples on how to use the JWT properties in a VRL expression:

```yaml
# Passes the user-id held in `.sub` claims of the token to the subgraph, or EMPTY
headers:
  all:
    request:
      - insert:
          name: X-User-ID
          expression: |
            if .request.jwt.authenticated == true {
              .request.jwt.claims.sub
            } else {
              "EMPTY"
            }
```

```yaml
# Passes a custom header based on the status of the authentication and the status of the JWT scopes
headers:
 subgraphs:
    accounts:
      request:
        - insert:
            name: X-Can-Read
            expression: |
              if .request.jwt.authenticated == true && includes!(.request.jwt.scopes, "read:accounts") {
                "Yes"
              } else {
                "No"
              }
```
