- `ConsumerSchema` and `ValidationPlan` now implement `hash` property, which is calculated based on the SDL string of the consumer schema and the validation rules when the struct is created or when a new rule is added to the validation plan.
- Validation cache key is generated by hashing the SDL string of the consumer schema, and the validation rules together with the operation itself.
- All schema AST nodes now implement `Hash` trait, which allows us to hash the entire schema AST when generating the validation cache key.
