### Features

#### Support environment variables in expressions

We have added support for using environment variables in expressions within the Hive Router configuration.

Example usage:
```
headers:
  all:
    response:
      - insert:
          name: "x-powered-by"
          expression: env("SERVICE_NAME", "default-value")
```

### Fixes

#### Extract expressions to hive-router-internal crate

The `expressions` module has been extracted from `hive-router-executor` into the `hive-router-internal` crate. This refactoring centralizes expressions handling, making it available to other parts of the project without depending on the executor.

It re-exports the `vrl` crate, ensuring that all consumer crates use the same version and types of VRL.
