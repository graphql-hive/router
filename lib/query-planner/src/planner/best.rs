//! This module solves the problem of finding the "best" execution plan for a
//! query that can be satisfied in many different ways by various subgraphs.
//!
//! The "best" plan is defined by a cost model that penalizes crossing
//! subgraph boundaries, and favors plans that are "local" to a single subgraph.
//!
//! A naive search to find the best combination would be exponentially slow (we were there...),
//! as the number of possible plans is the product of the number of choices for each part of
//! the query. This module implements a search algorithm to make this problem solved.
//!
//! The core of the solution is a Branch and Bound algorithm implemented over a
//! Depth-First Search (DFS). This approach explores all possible
//! combinations while aggressively pruning entire branches of the search space that
//! are guaranteed to not contain the optimal solution.
//!
//! The key components are:
//!
//! 1.  The query is broken down into independent decision points.
//!     For each point, there is a set of `Alternatives`, and each alternative is a
//!     `Candidate` plan fragment. The goal is to pick exactly one `Candidate` from
//!     each set of `Alternatives`.
//!
//! 2.  Before the main search, a fast Greedy Algorithm (`find_initial_plan`)
//!     is run to find a "good enough" initial plan.
//!     This provides a strong `best_cost` value, which is critical for making the
//!     pruning in the main search much more effective.
//!
//! 3.  The Bounding Function (`min_remaining_costs`) - this is the most important
//!     optimization. We pre-compute a vector that contains an optimistic,
//!     "best-case" cost for completing the plan from any given step to the end.
//!     It never overestimates the true cost, which allows
//!     for the pruning check: if a partial plan's cost plus the optimistic
//!     remaining cost is already worse than our best-found solution, we can safely
//!     abandon the entire branch.
//!
//! 4.  To find good solutions faster, we sort both the
//!     decision points and the choices themselves:
//!     -   Sets of `Alternatives` are sorted by size (fewest choices first) to reduce
//!         the branching factor and find a complete plan sooner.
//!     -   `Candidates` within each set are sorted by their individual cost to explore
//!         the most promising options first.
//!
//! 5.  The `Candidate` struct uses `OnceCell` to ensure that the
//!     potentially expensive work of building and costing a `QueryTree` is only ever
//!     done if a candidate is actually evaluated, and never more
//!     than once.
